# Full formalization coverage

## Objective and completion rule

Formalize the complete microcfta design in Lean. Prove that generation covers
all required terms, that sampling has the specified probabilities, and that
each optimization preserves its stated semantics. Keep the correspondence to
the actual Haskell algorithms explicit. Record implementation errors while
continuing the other proof work. Report the findings at the end.

This ledger distinguishes system modeling from complete implementation
verification. Every source module has an explicit semantic role and boundary.
Passing builds, theorem counts, and finite examples do not verify the whole
implementation. A proof row is complete only when its executable algorithm
has a checked semantic theorem and its implementation correspondence is
established. A theorem whose main algorithmic obligation is a premise
does not close that obligation. An implementation counterexample prevents a
soundness claim for that path; it does not remove that path from the scope.

Source baseline: `origin/microcfta` at `d7f7c11`. This includes the merged
core-formula changes at `9ad319d`. The current semantic specification and
implementation findings are in [SYSTEM.md](SYSTEM.md). All 66 source modules
are inventoried in [API-COVERAGE.md](API-COVERAGE.md).

The rebase retains the earlier fixes and adapts their size-mass transport to
paid constructors. The existing suites pass on this baseline: 260 core, 190
generator, and 135 refinement examples. The atomic-pair distribution and root
minimization failures still reproduce. Quantified substitution has a new
capture defect. Open-reference union has a confirmed documented term-loss
limit. Earlier reports are evidence snapshots, not completion reports.

## Coverage ledger

| --- | --- | --- |
| Term/path semantics: `Path`, `Term`, `Internal.Tree`, `Generic`, `Simple` | `Language`: finite runs, bounded enumeration, path lookup, equality sharing. `TermRepresentation`: all small-arity constructors, invariant, round trips and lookup. `LevelEnumeration`: first-deepest split, exact next level and safe empty-level stopping. `BoundDepth`: exact graph rewrite. `Construction`: nested constrained grammar compilation and finite state closure. `Generic`: terminating finite descriptor discovery, exact language, growth/domain failures and codec rank laws. `Template`: all five patterns and exact graph restriction. | Concrete sequence/hash storage, FTA validation, GHC generic type metadata, binder conversion and public wrapper correspondence. |
| Constraints: `Constraint`, `Equality.Constraint`, `Refinement.Guard` | `Guards`: Boolean evaluation and splitting. Concrete trie construction, ordered paths, prefix checks and descent. Canonical connected components and congruence saturation. Unconditional termination, exact semantics, constructive finite models, and rejection iff no model exists. | Source ST-array completion, mutable representation correspondence, residual guard decision and public arity wrappers. `EnumerationState` models suspended-path scheduling separately. |

## Evidence and boundaries

Each completed component must record the relevant Haskell definitions, the
Lean definitions and theorems, required representation invariants, and the
remaining connection to callers. Kernel checking must reject omitted proofs
and nonstandard axioms. Regression artifacts support source correspondence;
they do not replace its proof.

External components require explicit contracts: the Lean kernel, primitive
arithmetic/container behavior, the Haskell runtime and compiler, solver
answers, and random-bit generation. These contracts must not assume an
internal algorithm's desired result. Machine bounds, callback validity,
concurrent cache behavior, and termination must be addressed at their actual
use sites. This list records proof boundaries; it does not declare them
verified or exempt all code that uses an external component.

## Remaining proof obligations

- Connect the checked cumulative ranker to variable-order retries and source maps.
- Establish the full symbolic driver invariant across normalization, expansion,
  counting, rank selection, and memoized contexts.
- Connect equality completion to the source ST-array loop.
- Connect caller state, binder allocation, and substitution to the checked
  union-find, observation, and finite graph algorithms.
- Prove recursive pruning and supported recursive compilation terminate.
- Establish the remaining runtime, external solver, random-source, and codec
  correspondences at the stated boundaries.

The intended pipeline has composition theorems. The current implementation
has operational models, a complete module inventory, focused source checks,
and counterexamples. These are separate deliverables. The unresolved internal
proof obligations above prevent a whole-implementation verification claim.
